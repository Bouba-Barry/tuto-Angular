## Housing Location App With Angular

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Bouba-Barry/tuto-Angular/
cd tuto-Angular
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install
ng serve
```

the `npm install -g @angular/cli` command installs the Angular CLI globally on your system, allowing you to create and manage Angular projects.
The `ng serve` command compiles the application and starts a development server. You can then access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:4200/.
